# Lable_Converter
1.Conversion of one label to any other label by using conditional statements.

2.Actually, for Yolov5 there are many images and labelled files in the form of .txt format. So if we want to add any class to the existing classes, we need to give a number to that particular class. 

3.After getting the already lablled file from open source those lablled numbers or class numbers might be different. So we can convert as per our requirement.
